# Chatroom repo
-Works on the same LAN only.\
-Will need 3 or more machines to fully use ( one for server and two for clients )
-Find IP address of your machine using a command like ipinfo or ipconfig.
-Assign that IP address to host variable in the server code.
-Start the Chat_Server.py file on that machine.
-Assign the same IP address to host variable in the client code.
-Start the Chat_Client.py program on another machine(can use more than one).
